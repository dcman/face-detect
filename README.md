# Face Recognition and Photo Organizer

This project performs automatic face recognition, clustering of unknown individuals, and photo organization. It leverages `insightface` for face analysis, optionally applies super-resolution for small images using `Real-ESRGAN`, and organizes images by known individuals or clustered unknowns.

---

## Features

- Detect and identify known individuals based on reference images.
- Cluster unknown faces using DBSCAN.
- Optionally apply super-resolution to low-resolution images.
- Organize photos into folders per person/cluster.
- Generate preview images with bounding boxes and labels.
- Supports `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.bmp`, `.webp`, and `.tiff`.

## Setup Instructions

### ðŸ§° Dependencies (macOS & Windows)

Install Python 3.8 or later, then install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Your `requirements.txt` should include:

```txt
opencv-python
insightface
scikit-learn
numpy
torch
pillow
realesrgan
basicsr
```

> **Note:** On Windows, you may need to install `torch` with a compatible CUDA version or fallback to CPU.

### ðŸ“¦ External Models

This project requires:

1. **Real-ESRGAN x4+ model**  
   Download automatically on first run or manually from:  
   https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN/releases  
   Save as:  
   ```
   ./models/4xESRGAN.pth
   ```

2. **InsightFace models**  
   These are downloaded automatically on first run and stored in:
   ```
   ~/.insightface/models/
   ```

## Usage

Once all files are organized as shown above:

```bash
python main.py
```

Youâ€™ll see console logs detailing every stage, from face detection to organization and preview generation.

---

## Customization

Modify thresholds or paths via `config.py`:

- `SOURCE_DIR`, `OUTPUT_DIR`, `KNOWN_PEOPLE_DIR` â€” Input/output directories.
- `SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD` â€” Face match strictness.
- `CLUSTERING_EPS`, `CLUSTERING_MIN_SAMPLES` â€” DBSCAN parameters.
- `SR_UPSCALING_THRESHOLD` â€” Minimum image size before SR is applied.

---

## Notes

- This script runs best with a GPU (for InsightFace and Super-Resolution).
- For large photo collections, set `MAX_WORKERS` in `config.py` to match your CPU core count.
